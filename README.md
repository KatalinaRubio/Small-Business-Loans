# Small-Business-Loans
Do you have a small business or want to create one? Maybe you need a little extra cash to get you through these rough times of Covid-19. 
Maybe you should consider applying for a loan with the SBA, or Small Business Association. This is one of the best options for small businesses looking for a loan.
On average they give out 200,000 loans a year but they are very selective and end up denying hundreds of applications. 

Our goal to is give small businesses tips on how to be approved for a loan and not default on it. 

We analyzed the small business loan data from 1970-2014 to determine our overall goal of what factors heavily impact default rates. We also wanted to create a model
that will predict whether or not a loan will default or not after the loan is approved. Our data analysis consisted of analyzing columns such as industry, approval
year, term, and bank. We found that these columns were important in determining defaultness. We then created an XGBoost model to predict which approved loans will 
default.
